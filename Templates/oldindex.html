                        an 18-year-old from Bruce, Ms that comes from a nuclear family with strong cultural traditions, and
                        the first one in the family to have the chance for a better life. I was motivated by my Digital Media
                        teacher, Mrs. Powell, to apply for Base Camp, her advice was the best I could have ever taken. After
                        two important interviews, I was welcomed into Base Camp. I was asked if a had any experience in coding
                        my response was,
                    </p>
                    <p id="pullquote">
                        <q>I have no experience at all but I'm willing and open to gain any knowledge that will help me achieve
                            my goal</q>
                        <br />
                        <br/> The first time I heard of BCCA was during my senior year in high school. Tech-Careers are jobs that
                        will be hard to disappear over time, new items come out and there are tech-engineers who are finding
                        new ways to make technology more advance. Going into this field work, has great promises, but can
                        only be achieve by demonstrating a strong heart and mind that will later make me become a fantastic
                        software developer that works hard and has dedicaiton. </p>

                    <p style="text-indent: 40px">Before graduating from Bruce High School, I was excited to start a new phase as a senior, however, my
                        family had a bad economic breakdown, which made the life I was used to vanish completely. I went
                        through a lot of disappointments, but what matter the most was the support and unity of my family.
                        It was hard to see all my classmates apply for colleges and scholarships; therefore Base Camp has
                        been the greatest thing that has happened to me. Base Camp is not just a program in my opinion is
                        like,
                    </p>
                    <p id="pullquote">
                        <q>An open door to be someone in life and we can either decide whether to step in or be left outside.
                        </q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What I appreciate about Base Camp is their way to make anyone feel welcome and encorage their students to achieve their goals.
                        Since I entered Base Camp I had the chance to meet so many amazing people like FNC/CoreLogic staff,
                        RENASANT Bank sponsors, and Cspire employees that were BCCA graduates from 2017 and so many more.
                        A few months into BCCA, and I'm still excited for what's ahead to learn and achieve; therefore I
                        still don't know exactly what I will do after graduation life has shown me, that everything can change
                        in a second. But I do aspire for a better future where a can have a wonderful working place. One
                        thing I know for sure and will never change is to cherish every moment I can with my classmates,
                        because at the end they are the ones who will be permanent in my life.

                            Base Camp has been like a roller coaster since day one. Meeting knew people making contacts entering a work field full of
                            responsibility but enjoyable times. Base Camp gave "us" as students the chance to be who we are
                            and show our talents. I personally would encourage others to go out there and explore new things,
                            meet people, make connections, because after all those are the people that one day may help."In
                            a small classroom setting, students work with real world technologies to learn the fundamentals
                            of coding, app development and the life leadership skills they will need to be successful in
                            their career and competitive in the job market. The year-long program is free to students and
                            aims to help address the private sector's historical shortage of high-tech skilled labor by training
                            local youth to fill the positions."
