                        student, who was nominated for 2018 graduation class; an 18-year-old from Bruce, Ms that comes from
                        a nuclear family with strong cultural traditions, and the first one in the family to have the chance
                        for a better life. I was motivated by my Digital Media teacher, Mrs. Powell, to apply for Base Camp,
                        her advice was the best I could have ever taken. After two main/important interviews, I was welcomed
                        into Base Camp. I was asked if a had any experience in coding my response was,
                    </p>
                    <p id="pullquote"><q>I have no experience at all but I'm willing and open to gain any knowledge that will help me achieve my goal</q><br
                        /><br/> The first time I heard of BCCA was during my senior year in high school. To learn new things,
                        especially, in the Tech-Industry, is something I was really interesting on. Tech-Careers are jobs
                        that will be hard to disappear over time, new items come out and there are tech-engineers who are
                        finding new ways to make technology more advance. Going into this field work, has great promises,
                        but can only be achieve by demonstrating a Strong Heart and Mind that will later make me become a
                        fantastic software developer that works hard and has dedicaiton. </p>

                    <p style="text-indent: 40px">Before graduating from Bruce High School, I was excited to start a new phase as a senior, however, my
                        family had a bad economic breakdown, which made the life I was used to vanish completely. I went
                        through a lot of disappointments, but what matter the most was the support and unity of my family.
                        It was hard to see all my classmates apply for colleges and scholarships; therefore Base Camp has
                        been the greatest thing that has happened to me. Base Camp is not just a program in my opinion is
                        like,
                        <p id="pullquote"><q>An open door to be someone in life and we can either decide whether to step in or be left outside.</q><br/><br/>                            What I appreciate about Base Camp is their way to make anyone feel welcome and encorage their
                            students to achieve their goals. Since I enter Base Camp I had the chance to meet so many amazing
                            people like FNC/CoreLogic staff, RENASANT Bank sponsors, and Cspire employees that were BCCA
                            graduates from 2017 and so many more. A few months into BCCA, I'm still excited for what's ahead
                            to learn and achieve; therefore I still don't know exactly what I will do after graduation life
                            has shown me, that everything can change in a second. But I do aspire for a better future where
                            a can have a wonderful working place. One thing I know for sure and will never change is to cherish
                            every moment I can with my classmates, because at the end they are the ones who will be permanent
                            in my life.

                            app development and the life leadership skills they will need to be successful in their career
                            and competitive in the job market. The year-long program is free to students and aims to help

                            youth to fill the positions. Every year, Mississippi has 1,200 unfilled computing jobs and less

                        <p>Python programming is the first language taught in BCCA. Put simply, a programming (or coding) language
                            is a set of syntax rules that define how code should be written and formatted. Thousands of different
                            programming languages make it possible for us to create computer software, apps and websites.
                            During this first 3 months in BCCA, I have created and modify projects. I made a gas_pump project
                            in python were I used a shell, core, and a disk to make the Whole Project work together as one,
                            nevertheless I modified a GUI-Tetris game and a snake game. For the Gladiator Project I didn't
                            use any dictionaries or special feature, however, it has the basics that make it work perfectly,
                            for a first learner in python. In BCCA every student is allowed to have their own thoughts and
                            ideas, therefore after the end of July students are given a set of instructions do their own
                            creative/unique project. In this case, I was assigned to do a <i>Rental Agency</i> In <i>GitHub</i>                            I had to commit for every change a made. By the end of the deadline, I had created a good working
                            Tennis Agency where customers could come in and rent any item they wanted and enter their name
                            when item/s were returned; it also gave them automatically there deposit back.The special feature
                            was the manager account, where only the manager could log-in and check all the revenue.</p>
