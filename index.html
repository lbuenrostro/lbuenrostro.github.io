                    <p>Python programming is the first language taught in BCCA. Put simply, a programming (or coding) language
                        is a set of syntax rules that define how code should be written and formatted. Thousands of different
                        programming languages make it possible for us to create computer software, apps and websites. During
                        this first 3 months in BCCA, I have created and modify projects. I made a gas_pump project in python
                        were I used a shell, core, and a disk to make the Whole Project work together as one, nevertheless
                        I modified a GUI-Tetris game and a snake game. For the Gladiator Project I didn't use any dictionaries
                        or special feature, however, it has the basics that make it work perfectly, for a first learner in
                        python. In BCCA every student is allowed to have their own thoughts and ideas, therefore after the
                        end of July students are given a set of instructions do their own creative/unique project. In this
                        case, I was assigned to do a
                        <i>Rental Agency</i> In
                        <i>GitHub</i> I had to commit for every change a made. By the end of the deadline, I had created a good
                        working Tennis Agency where customers could come in and rent any item they wanted and enter their
                        name when item/s were returned; it also gave them automatically there deposit back.The special feature
                        was the manager account, where only the manager could log-in and check all the revenue.

                    increasingly more difficult as the length of the snake grows.

                    I used a new package manager called Yarn, this package has a set of existing workflows while operating faster, more securely,
                    and more reliably. For this project I coded in Javascript, however, I stared with Jinja, and jQuery.
                    In Javascript, functions have to be used where they all connect and work together, along with html and
                    css(optional). I made different types of "attack" buttons that would react when click by users. Also,
                    I use html to design and build the website.
