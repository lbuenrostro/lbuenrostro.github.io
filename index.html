                        an 18-year-old from Bruce, Ms that comes from a nuclear family with strong cultural traditions, and
                        the first one in the family to have the chance for a better life. I was motivated by my Digital Media
                        teacher, Mrs. Powell, to apply for Base Camp, her advice was the best I could have ever taken. After
                        two important interviews, I was welcomed into Base Camp. I was asked if a had any experience in coding
                        my response was,
                    </p>
                    <p id="pullquote">
                        <q>I have no experience at all but I'm willing and open to gain any knowledge that will help me achieve
                            my goal</q>
                        <br />
                        <br/> The first time I heard of BCCA was during my senior year in high school. Tech-Careers are jobs that
                        will be hard to disappear over time, new items come out and there are tech-engineers who are finding
                        new ways to make technology more advance. Going into this field work, has great promises, but can
                        only be achieve by demonstrating a strong heart and mind that will later make me become a fantastic
                        software developer that works hard and has dedicaiton. </p>

                <div class="info">
                    <p style="text-indent: 40px">Before graduating from Bruce High School, I was excited to start a new phase as a senior, however, my
                        family had a bad economic breakdown, which made the life I was used to vanish completely. I went
                        through a lot of disappointments, but what matter the most was the support and unity of my family.
                        It was hard to see all my classmates apply for colleges and scholarships; therefore Base Camp has
                        been the greatest thing that has happened to me. Base Camp is not just a program in my opinion is
                        like,
                    </p>
                    <p id="pullquote">
                        <q>An open door to be someone in life and we can either decide whether to step in or be left outside.
                        </q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What I appreciate about Base Camp is their way to make anyone feel welcome and encorage their students to achieve their goals.
                        Since I entered Base Camp I had the chance to meet so many amazing people like FNC/CoreLogic staff,
                        RENASANT Bank sponsors, and Cspire employees that were BCCA graduates from 2017 and so many more.
                        A few months into BCCA, and I'm still excited for what's ahead to learn and achieve; therefore I
                        still don't know exactly what I will do after graduation life has shown me, that everything can change
                        in a second. But I do aspire for a better future where a can have a wonderful working place. One
                        thing I know for sure and will never change is to cherish every moment I can with my classmates,
                        because at the end they are the ones who will be permanent in my life.

                            Base Camp has been like a roller coaster since day one. Meeting knew people making contacts entering a work field full of
                            responsibility but enjoyable times. Base Camp gave "us" as students the chance to be who we are
                            and show our talents. I personally would encourage others to go out there and explore new things,
                            meet people, make connections, because after all those are the people that one day may help."In
                            a small classroom setting, students work with real world technologies to learn the fundamentals
                            of coding, app development and the life leadership skills they will need to be successful in
                            their career and competitive in the job market. The year-long program is free to students and
                            aims to help address the private sector's historical shortage of high-tech skilled labor by training
                            local youth to fill the positions."

                        <p>Python programming is the first language taught in BCCA. Put simply, a programming (or coding) language
                            is a set of syntax rules that define how code should be written and formatted. Thousands of different
                            programming languages make it possible for us to create computer software, apps and websites.
                            During this first 3 months in BCCA, I have created and modify projects. I made a gas_pump project
                            in python were I used a shell, core, and a disk to make the Whole Project work together as one,
                            nevertheless I modified a GUI-Tetris game and a snake game. For the Gladiator Project I didn't
                            use any dictionaries or special feature, however, it has the basics that make it work perfectly,
                            for a first learner in python. In BCCA every student is allowed to have their own thoughts and
                            ideas, therefore after the end of July students are given a set of instructions do their own
                            creative/unique project. In this case, I was assigned to do a
                            <i>Rental Agency</i> In
                            <i>GitHub</i> I had to commit for every change a made. By the end of the deadline, I had created
                            a good working Tennis Agency where customers could come in and rent any item they wanted and
                            enter their name when item/s were returned; it also gave them automatically there deposit back.The
                            special feature was the manager account, where only the manager could log-in and check all the
                            revenue.

                        <p class="indent">The player is represented as a snake, which grows if it eats (x). The goal of the game is to eat
                            as many as possible without colliding into yourself. This is very easy in the early phase of
                            the game, but is increasingly more difficult as the length of the snake grows.

                        <p class="indent">This game was all written in python, We define a class Player, which holds the player's position
                            on the screen and the speed by which it moves. In addition, we define the actions a Player instance,
                            can do (movements).

                        <p> Html is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted in a file intended for display on a World Wide
                            Web browser page. The markup tells the Web browser how to display a Web page's words and images
                            for the user. The first day of html being presented to the class, I made a similar Base Camp
                            Website using just Html and Css. I used most of the book requirements on how to insert a list,
                            links, images, tables, flash/video&audio, color, ect.

                            I used a new package manager called Yarn, this package has a set of existing workflows while operating faster, more securely,
                            and more reliably. For this project I coded in Javascript, however, I stared with Jinja, and
                            jQuery. In Javascript, functions have to be used where they all connect and work together, along
                            with html and css(optional). I made different types of "attack" buttons that would react when
                            click by users. Also, I use html to design and build the website.
