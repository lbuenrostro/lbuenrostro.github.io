                        My name is Lizeth Buenrostro, and I'm currently enrolled in Base Camp Coding Academy, learning Computer programming languages.
                        I grew up in Bruce, Ms mostly all my life, coming from a family of four. I personally think Base
                        Camp is a lifetime opportunity for fresh high School Seniors. The reason I'm a software developer
                        is that I'm always fascinated on how anyone can communicate with a computer and how much it takes
                        to do so, in the process I learn that, "Tech-Careers are jobs that will be hard to disappear over
                        time, Going into this field work, has great promises, but can only be achieve by demonstrating a
                        strong heart and mind that will later make me become a fantastic software developer that works hard
                        and has dedication."

                        <p style="text-indent: 40px">Before graduating from Bruce High School, I was excited to start a new phase as a senior, however,
                            my family had a bad economic breakdown, therefore Base Camp has been the greatest thing that
                            has happened to me. Base Camp has been like a roller coaster since day one. Meeting knew people
                            making contacts entering a work field full of responsibility but enjoyable times. Base Camp gave
                            "us" as students the chance to be who we are and show our talents. I personally would encourage
                            others to go out there and explore new things, meet people, make connections, because after all
                            those are the people that one day may help. What I appreciate about Base Camp is their way to
                            make anyone feel welcome and encorage their students to achieve their goals. Since I entered
                            Base Camp I had the chance to meet so many amazing people like FNC/CoreLogic staff, RENASANT
                            Bank sponsors, and Cspire employees that were BCCA graduates from 2017 and so many more. A few
                            months into BCCA, and I'm still excited for what's ahead to learn and achieve; therefore I still
                            don't know exactly what I will do after graduation life has shown me, that everything can change
                            in a second. But I do aspire for a better future where a can have a wonderful working place.

                                Created a replica of Instagram, allows Image Uploads and apply built-in PIL Filters. The requirement was to Utilize Python
                                Imaging Library, PIL to make own custom filters that can be applied to any Upload images.
                                The Project is focused in using the Server, a back-end support , which helps store all Image

                        I used a new package manager called Yarn, this package has a set of existing workflows while operating faster, more securely,
                        and more reliably. For this project I coded in Javascript, however, I stared with Jinja, and jQuery.
                        In Javascript, functions have to be used where they all connect and work together, along with html
                        and css(optional). I made different types of "attack" buttons that would react when click by users.
                        Also, I use html to design and build the website.

                    <p> Html is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted in a file intended for display on a World Wide Web
                        browser page. The markup tells the Web browser how to display a Web page's words and images for the
                        user. The first day of html being presented to the class, I made a similar Base Camp Website using
                        just Html and Css. I used most of the book requirements on how to insert a list, links, images, tables,
                        flash/video&audio, color, ect.
