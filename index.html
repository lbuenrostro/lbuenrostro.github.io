                    <p> <img src="../../html/cover_portfolio/lisa.jpg" width="235" height="320" align="left"> I am Lizeth Buenrostro,
                        Base Camp Base Camp Coding Academy student, who was nominated for 2018 graduation class; an 18-year-old
                        from Bruce, Ms that comes from a nuclear family with strong cultural traditions, and the first one
                        in the family to have the chance for a better life. I was motivated by my Digital Media teacher,
                        Mrs. Powell, to apply for Base Camp, her advice was the best I could have ever taken. After two main/important
                        interviews, I was welcomed into Base Camp. I was asked if a had any experience in coding my response
                        was,
                        <p id="pullquote"><q>I have no experience at all but I'm willing and open to gain more knowledge that will help me be successful</q><br
                            /><br/> The first time I heard of BCCA was during my senior year in high school. To learn new
                            things, especially, in the Tech-Industry, is something I was really interesting on. Tech-Careers
                            are jobs that will be hard to disappear over time, new items come out and there are tech-engineers
                            who are finding new ways to make technology more advance. Going into this field work, has great
                            promises, but can only be achieve by demonstrating a Strong Heart and Mind that will later make
                            me become a fantastic software developer that works hard and has dedicaiton. </p>

                    <p>Python programming is the first language taught in BCCA. Put simply, a programming (or coding) language
                        is a set of syntax rules that define how code should be written and formatted. Thousands of different
                        programming languages make it possible for us to create computer software, apps and websites. During
                        this first 3 months in BCCA, I have created and modify projects. I made a gas_pump project in python
                        were I used a shell, core, and a disk to make the Whole Project work together as one, nevertheless
                        I modified a GUI-Tetris game and a snake game. For the Gladiator Project I didn't use any dictionaries
                        or special feature, however, it has the basics that make it work perfectly, for a first learner in
                        python. In BCCA every student is allowed to have their own thoughts and ideas, therefore after the
                        end of July students are given a set of instructions do their own creative/unique project. In this
                        case, I was assigned to do a <i>Rental Agency</i> In <i>GitHub</i> I had to commit for every change
                        a made. By the end of the deadline, I had created a good working Tennis Agency where customers could
                        come in and rent any item they wanted and enter their name when item/s were returned; it also gave
                        them automatically there deposit back.The special feature was the manager account, where only the
                        manager could log-in and check all the revenue.</p>
